# bazeanproblem


The script attached should do each problem specified in the emailed pdf. It uses the two files emailed to intern candidates.

It outputs three text files.
The first is the aggregate oil production by company over time, the second is average oil production per well by company over time, and
the last is the ordering of future most productive companies over time, using linear regression. I did not have time to 
fully flesh my prediction method out, so it outputs an odd list.
